Forces all user passwords generated by WordPress to be hashed using Bcrypt, the most secure and popular PHP hashing algorithm currently available.

== Description ==

> Forces all user passwords generated by WordPress to be hashed using Bcrypt, the most secure and popular PHP hashing algorithm currently available.

In the future (PHP 7.2) we may have an option for Argon2 hashing, to eventually replace Bcrypt.

The plugin gracefully replaces WordPress password hashing (MD5) with PHP 5.5+ built in hashing which is much stronger, so in the case your password hashes are exposed it would be much more difficult for hackers to brute force them.
